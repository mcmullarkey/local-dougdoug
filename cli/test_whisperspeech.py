'''
DESCRIPTION~

Process text one sentence at a time and add them to a queue to be played, which shortens the wait time for audio to be played.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS~

(1)  create a virtual environment and activate it
(2)  install pytorch by going to the following website and running the appropriate command for your platform and setup:

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

(3)  pip3 install WhisperSpeech
(4)  pip3 install sounddevice==0.4.6
(5)  python text_to_audio_playback.py

This script processes a body of text one sentence at a time and plays them consecutively.  This enables the audio playback to begin sooner instead of waiting for the entire body of text to be processed.  The script uses the threading and queue modules that are part of the standard Python library.  It also uses the sound device library, which is fairly reliable across different platforms.  I hope you enjoy, and feel free to modify or distribute at your pleasure.
